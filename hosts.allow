# hosts.allow   This file contains access rules which are used to
#               allow or deny connections to network services that
#               either use the tcp_wrappers library or that have been
#               started through a tcp_wrappers-enabled xinetd.
######### PRECIDENCE between Hosts.Allow  and Hosts.deny
##If the address is listed in the hosts.allow file, the connection is allowed and hosts.deny is not checked.
##If the address is not matched in hosts.allow, but is in hosts.deny, the connection is denied.
##If the address is in neither file, the connection is allowed.# you should know that NFS uses portmap!
